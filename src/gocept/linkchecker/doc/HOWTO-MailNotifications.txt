What are mail notifications
===========================

Mail notifications allow you to keep your authors informed about possible
broken links in the site by sending them regularly email, listing all broken
links.

Mail notification modes
=======================

Standard
--------

The users receive an overview of the links in the selected states they wished
to be informed about.

E.g. all their links in "red" state.

Update
------
 
Only show differences to the last notification (e.g. which links went out of
"red" and which links went into "red" since last time.) 

Triggering mail notifications
=============================

Due to virtual hosting problems it is necessary to trigger the mail
notifications from outside the Zope-Server using a normal special user
account. You can do that e.g. with wget in conjunction with cron::

    wget -S -O - http://<username>:<password>@<official.name>/<plone_site>/portal_linkchecker/reports/MailNotifications

For example::

    wget -S -O - http://mailuser:mailpassword@www.gocept.com/portal_linkchecker/reports/MailNotifications
    
The user needs the 'Linkchecker: Run mail notifications' permission. You must
not trigger the mail notifications more than once an hour; otherwise your
users would get multiple reports per hour.
    
Plone Options
=============

Every user of your plone site can configure the times they wish to be informed,
the contents and the mode of their notifications. The email adress presented in
their portal profile will be used for the mail.

HTML-Mail
=========

The linkchecker sends out a HTML mail including CSS to highlight things.
Currently the CSS is known to work with Microsoft Outlook and Mozilla Mail. The CSS
is known not to work with Ximian Evolution.
